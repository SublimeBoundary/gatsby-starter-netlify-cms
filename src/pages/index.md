  description: >
    At Sublime Boundary all of our products are handmade in Hove to high
    standards. We source all of our paper directly from FSC-certified suppliers
    to ensure sustainability from the forest to our door. We pigment-print our
    artworks onto these high-quality papers and hand-finish everything to ensure
    a premium quality product.

  AI-art by Ganzfeld Studio have a dream-like quality and a tactile, textured

  heading: Great coffee with no compromises
  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
